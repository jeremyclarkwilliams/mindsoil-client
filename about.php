      <p class="desc">Founder &amp; Director of Photography</p>
      <p class="desc">Mindsoil was founded by three-time Emmy Award winner and Producers Guild Award recipient, John Moody, as a vehicle to tell stories beyond the world of Television. Throughout his career, a focus on learning and acquiring technology has left John with years of experience and a studio filled with camera, lighting, editing and audio equipment. These assets and a network of talented individuals are the sum of the parts that is Mindsoil.</p>

          <q class="text">Simply put, John Moody is a storytelling machine. Since the early days running Deadliest Catch, I always appreciated his zeal for wanting to tell a story in the most cinematic way possible and doing it with a smile (even in the worst conditions mother nature can throw at a shooter). After launching Undertow, I leaned on John for several series &ndash; History's "Shark Wranglers", AMC's "Game of Arms" promos/sales tape, and Discovery's "Airplane Repo".</q>

          <q class="text">As the series producer for the History Channel series, I had the pleasure of working with John on the uniquely challenging project, "Shark Wranglers". John was the DP and did a killer job of capturing both the fearsome beauty of this infamous fish and the tumultuous story of a boat under seige by the South African government. I'm probably more proud of this show than anything else I've ever done, and Mr. Moody is a big reason why. He did an excellent job capturing the drama and beauty of a once-in-a-lifetime project. He's also a mensch and a damn fine DJ.</q>
